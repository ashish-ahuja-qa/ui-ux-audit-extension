Your job is to find real problems that make users struggle.\n\n**EXAMPLES OF REAL PROBLEMS TO LOOK FOR:**\n\n**HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES:**\n- Navigation that's hard to find or confusing\n- Buttons that don't look clickable\n- Text that's too small to read easily\n- Important information buried or hidden\n- Forms with unclear labels or requirements\n- Broken visual hierarchy (unclear what's most important)\n- Inconsistent spacing that looks unprofessional\n- Elements that don't align properly\n- Poor contrast making text hard to read\n- Missing feedback for user actions\n\n**MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES:**\n- Inconsistent button styles\n- Unclear icon meanings\n- Information that's poorly organized\n- Inefficient workflows\n- Labels that could be clearer\n- Typography inconsistencies\n- Spacing that could be more consistent\n\n**WHAT MAKES A REAL PROBLEM:**\n- Users would notice it and be frustrated\n- It slows down task completion\n- It makes the interface look unprofessional\n- It creates confusion about what to do next\n- It violates common design patterns users expect\n\n**ANALYSIS APPROACH:**\n1. Scan the entire interface quickly\n2. Ask: \"What would frustrate me as a user here?\"\n3. Look for anything that stands out as wrong or inconsistent\n4. Focus on the most obvious problems first\n5. Don't overthink - trust your instincts\n\n**REPORT FORMAT:**\n[PRIORITY] Issue Description\n- Impact: How this hurts users\n- Fix: Specific solution\n\n**Be direct and practical. If something looks wrong, it probably is.**" },
