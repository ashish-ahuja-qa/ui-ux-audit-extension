Priority Level - One of:\n[CRITICAL] â€“ Blocks task completion or causes major confusion\n[HIGH] â€“ Strongly disrupts ease of use or leads to errors\n[ACCESSIBILITY] â€“ Creates a barrier for users with disabilities\n[MEDIUM] â€“ Noticeably slows users down or creates minor frustration\n[LOW] â€“ Noticed by advanced users but doesn't prevent success\n\n2. WHAT: Exact component or UI element causing the issue\n3. WHY: How it impacts user experience in a practical way\n4. HOW: Specific, realistic fix to eliminate or reduce the problem\n\nFocus on task completion, clarity, and usability, not visual trends. Always ask: Could this make someone fail or hesitate during a task? Prioritize issues that affect most users, especially new or mobile users.\n\nYour goal is not to make it prettier â€” your goal is to make it unblockably usable." },
